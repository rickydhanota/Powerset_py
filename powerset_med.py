#Powerset

#Write a function that takes in an array of unique integers and returns its powerset.
#The powerset P(X) of a set X is the set of all the subsets of X. for example, the powerset of [1, 2] is [[], [1], [2], [1, 2]]
#Note that the power sets do not need to be in any particular order

#Array = [1, 2, 3]
#[[], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
